## NostrRef
========

See what is referenced in your relays
-------------------------------------

### WIP!

When you press 'Fetch your relays' it will find your public relay list and then it will scrape your relays looking for notes with a '#r' tag, at the same time it will count how many times an 'r value' is repeated and its gonna show you in a sorted list.

'R values' are links that take you to a chat.punkhub, nostrichat instance whit this ref set as topic. There you'll be able to see what the peops are talking about that ref.

More PoW comming, expects improvements
