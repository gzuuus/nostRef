## NostrRef
========

See what is referenced in your relays
-------------------------------------

### WIP!

When you press 'Fetch your relays' it will find your public relay list and then it will scrape your relays looking for notes with a '#r' tag, at the same time it will count how many times an 'r value' is repeated and it will show you in a sorted list.

R-values are links that take you to a chat.punkhub, for example, with that ref set as the topic. There you'll be able to see what the peeps are talking about that ref and you'll be able to comment too!

More PoW coming, expect improvements
